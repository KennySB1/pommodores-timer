#### What is this project?

This was our final project at Makers academy where we had two weeks to make a tech project with no directions on tech stack, project specifications, or how to work. 

Our team, the Pommodores, made a pomodoro application that lets users:
* manage a todo list
* see and customise suggestions for things to do in their breaks
* check the statistics for how long they spent working on pomodoros.
* Customise how long their pomodoros and breaks will be
* Make an account that saves their work for future usage.
